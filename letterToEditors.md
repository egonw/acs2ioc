Dear XXXXX,

with this email we would like to ask your attention to the following request.

Citations, the facts that one articles cites others, are an essential part of
academic discourse. Whether they are used to find related literature, look up
cited work, or measuring citation statistics, citations have become a core part
of doing research.

To support research many publishers have joined the Initiative for Open
Citations (I4OC) [0]. Via I4OC they allow others to use the citation data which is
already provided in a machine readable way (e.g. CrossRef). This initiave includes publishers
of subscription journals and does not require articles to be Open Access. It only
requires a single email to join the I4OC and support the research around the
world. The benefits are not limited to just chemistry, but many disciplines, as
chemistry is a quite central science.

We would like to ask your support, as we think open citations is contributing
to the value of journals. The citations in your journal will certainly contain
also citations of other articles of your journal. By opening up these data
these links to your journal can be used in variety of contexts and thereby
even helping with the dissemination.

We have started a petition to the publishing side of the American Chemical
Society to join the I4OC [1]. At this moment, more than 300 people have shown
their support for this request. Please consider also to join the crowd of
supporters of this petition. It would be even more
valuable if we can name you as supporter of joining the I4OC.

You may have questions about the petition, I4OC, open citations
themselves, the use of citations in research, and perhaps how open citations
can help your journal. I have started tweeting a number of example user stories
under the hashtag #acs2ioc [2].

We are looking forward to hearing your thoughts, ideas, comments, questions,
and, of course, your support,

with kind regards,

Egon Willighagen
